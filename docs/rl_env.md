# MiningEnv

`MiningEnv` is a Gymnasium-compatible environment wrapping the `FMSManager` simulation.

## Observation Space
The observation vector has 11 continuous values:
1. Simulation tick count
2. Total mineral processed
3. Total waste dumped
4. Length of the crusher queue
5. Length of the dump queue
6-11. Queue length at each of the six shovels

The values are normalised to the `[0,1]` range using predefined factors.

## Action Space
A discrete action selects one of the possible dispatch commands generated by the manager. The space size is `number_of_trucks * 6` (36). Invalid actions are masked via the `action_mask` entry in `info`.

## Reward
The reward combines throughput, truck efficiency and queue penalties:
```
reward = (mineral_processed + waste_dumped) + mean_truck_efficiency - total_queues
```
This encourages high production while avoiding excessive queues.
